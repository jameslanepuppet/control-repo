# A Puppet Control Repository for Basics Three: Windows

Here's a visual representation of the structure of this repository:

All code contains comments with what module is required

Basics Three: Windows
Familiarize yourself with common Windows administration tasks, and how they differ from their Linux counterparts.

In conjunction with your control repo, create a new module/profile to perform the following:

Local Accounts
- Create a local user
- Create a local group
- Ensure the user is in the group
- Grant your user the "Log on as a Service" right

File and directory permissions
- Create a new directory
- Ensure its owner is the user you are managing
- Ensure its group similarly
- Inspect the directory permissions
- Manage the directory permissions using the puppetlabs/acl module
- Grant the local user Full Control
- Grant the local group Read Only permissions
- Note: ACLs are similar but not the same as Linux permissions

Registry
- Use the puppetlabs/registry module to do the following:
- Enable Internet Explorer enhanced security configuration (IEESC)
- Enable the Windows Shutdown Event Tracker

IIS
- Use the puppetlabs/dism, puppet/windowsfeature or puppetlabs/dsc_lite modules to install IIS
- Use the puppetlabs/iis module to create a basic website
- Note: the terminology and architecture of IIS differs a bit from something like Apache

Package Management
- Install 7-zip using the puppet/staging archive module - deprecated module use puppet/archive instead
- Install 7-zip using chocolatey and the puppetlabs/chocolatey forge module

Reboots
- Extend your 7-zip code to use puppetlabs/reboot the system after installing 7-zip
- Uninstall 7-zip and verify that the system reboots after reinstalling
- Note: there are a few subtly different reboot styles in this module.
